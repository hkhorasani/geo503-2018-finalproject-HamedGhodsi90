# Inroduction

 This project provides documentation for the analysis of an anonymos city sewer collection system model. The purpose of this report is to provide the interpretation of **SWMM** (Stormwater Management Model) output files. The SWMM model has provided two output files. The first one is a report file (".rpt") which include the all cumulative results from the simulation model. The second one is a binary file (".out") which include the time series analysis of different elements of the model like subcatchments, nodes and links.
